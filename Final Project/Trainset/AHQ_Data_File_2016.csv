Question 3, Part I requests the number of dedicated operating rooms by type of surgery. Our hospital has one dedicated daVinci robotic surgery which is used to perform both urological and gynecological surgery cases. We reported this dedicated room under the “Urology” section.    2. Question IV.f  requests the number of dedicated C-Section rooms, counted under the total operating rooms. While our hospital does not have dedicated C-Section rooms located within the operating room, we included these rooms only in question IV.f.    3. Question VII.2 requests the total catheterization procedures performed including all diagnostic, interventional and EP procedures for all age groups. It is noted that we have not included PV cases performed in our cath lab.    4. Question VIII.F requests the number of visits to Emergency and Trauma. Our hospital had 9,222 trauma patients, defined as ICD9 code 800-999.9.    5. Question XII.A-3 requests the number of mammography exams performed. It is noted that all mammography exams performed are done so under our physician group, Rockford Health Physicians.    6. Question XII.A-8 a. and b. requests the number of diagnostic and interventional angiography procedures performed. It is noted that, because angiography could be both a diagnostic as well as interventional procedure, we reported our angiography procedures under the interventional angiography category.",,Sue Ripsch,Senior Vice President,3/16/17,http://www.rockfordhealthsystem.org/about-us/community-benefit

Inpatient and Outpatient Net Revenues During Your Reported Fiscal Year By Payor    As has been done previouly, Rush has adjusted the Private Payment Net Revenue inpatient and outpatient figures for FY 2016 to more properly reflect the actual amounts received from this payor class which Rush internally classifies as Self Pay/Charity.  Because of Rush’s accounting practices, there is only a small amount of non-payment which is classified as contractual allowance for this group.  The remainder of the unpaid portion would have been reflected in Rush’s figures as full charges for Charity Care patients as part of net revenue.   This has been corrected by applying an average collection rate for that group of patients and we feel that the Net Revenue amounts shown in the 2016 Questionnaire presents a more accurate depiction of the payments realized from this payor class.",,Arth Patel,Strategy Manager,3/15/17,https://www.rush.edu/sites/default/files/community-benefits-report-2015.pdf

Key notes are included below.   PART I Question II – Facility Ownership and Administration  • A./B. – The hospital is licensed under the name, “Copley Memorial Hospital”, however, the hospital is known to the community as “Rush-Copley Medical Center”.  Per conversation with Anu Meeka on 3/5/2012, the hospital should report the legal entity name as “Rush-Copley Medical Center” on this survey.  Question VIII – Emergency/Trauma Care  • D. – There are no operating rooms dedicated to trauma, but one operating room is always available for trauma.  • F. – The total number of patients admitted from the ED equals ED admits (5,427).  Trauma admits are a subset of the total ED admits (404 of 5,427 admits).  The hospital ED utilization does not include the Rush-Copley Emergency Center, Yorkville.   Question X – Patients Served during Calendar Year 2016 by Primary Payor   • The reported number of charity care patients is reflective of only those CY2016 patients who had qualified for charity care at the time the AHQ was completed and does not include additional CY2016 patients that will qualify for charity care after the survey is submitted.         PART II Question 3 – AMOUNT OF CHARITY CARE SERVICES PROVIDED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR  • The source for the amount of charity care provided to patients served during the fiscal year is the hospital’s community benefit report for the same time period.  Per conversation with Mike Mitchell (3/28/14), it is acceptable to report the amount of charity care provided from the community benefit report/990 tax return filing to allow for consistent reporting of this information.",,Barry C.

P9.Q.VIII Emergency/Trauma- Trauma counts are consistent with trauma ICD-10 Dx Code definitions for CY16.  Admitted patients from SAMC Belvidere that required specialized IP care were transferred via ambulance to SAH Rockford for their IP stay.  These admissions were included in the Belvidere survey and not in the Rockford counts.  P10.Q.IX.B-Outpatient Visits.

Part I Question III Surgical Hours (Page 7)        Current IT platform has no way of calculating room turn time.  For the purposes of this survey, an average of 30 minutes per case has been added to factor in cleanup/set up of surgical cases.  Part I Question III Operating Rooms (Class C)       This campus has 6 class C operating rooms and 2 minor procedure rooms.  In previous years, the minor procedure rooms were inaccurately captured in the OR count and surgical hours data was captured through cost center information.  Part I Question IIIA surgical Procedures, Invasive, Non OR (Page 8)       Pain Management procedures – Minor pain procedures are performed with fluoroscopy, but according to the survey’s definition, these procedures would not qualify in this section.  We do not perform procedures “in conjunction with oral, parenteral, or IV sedation or under analgesic or dissociative drugs” in these rooms.

So all CT Angiographies (CTAs) are included in this section.    Note that CT Angios are performed on the CT Scanner.  Part 1 Question VIII Section F (Page 9) Number of admissions to the hospital.       It should be noted that the number populated on page 9 reflects the number of admissions to Trinity Moline from Trinity Moline’s Emergency Department (ie.124).  The majority of admissions that stemmed from Trinity Moline emergency visits were actually transferred to Trinity Rock Island for admission.  In 2016, there were 1,645 Trinity Moline emergency department visits that resulted in Trinity Rock Island admissions.  Part I Question VIII; E. (Page 9)       2 Additional ED treatments stations have been added that focus on Obstetrical patients.  Part I Question XII.A.1. (Page 11)       An additional general rad/fluoroscopy piece of equipment is included in the total this year, as uroscopy equipment in the OR has traditionally been overlooked as part of this reporting.  Page 11 A1 General Rad     In order to report general rad volumes without portables, Trinity has to rely on the room location entered by the technologist into the radiology information system.  There were 356 exams designated as portable for the room location.  Trinity’s financial system has no way of identifying portable vs fixed exams due to the conversion to EPIC and the requirement that a CPT code can only be utilized once.  Total exams (including portables) in 2016 were 22,682.  Part I Question XII 9a,b  (Page 11)    IMRT’s have now been bundled in with IGRT’s and we do not have a good way to break them apart.  Page 13 (Ultrasound Guided Breast Biopsy and Stereotactic Biopsy     We believe this field is asking for number of cases (ie.patients).  That is what has been provided.

Part I, Question VIII: Emergency/Trauma Care – F.   Trauma Visits and Trauma Admissions to Hospital: According to Illinois Department of Public Health Emergency Medical Systems and Highway Safety website, UIH is not listed as a trauma center and therefore does not have to report trauma visits and admissions.     Part II, Question 3:   Actual Cost of Services Provided to Charity Care inpatients and outpatients during your reported fiscal year: Per AHQ instructions, the reporting entity must report the actual cost of services provided based on the total cost to charge ratio derived from the hospital's Medicare cost report (CMS 2552-96 Worksheet C, Part 1, PPS Inpatient Ratios). Following those instructions, UIMCC’s reported total cost of services for inpatient and outpatient services is $7,763,913. UIMCC would like to indicate that on UIMCC’s audited financial statements for FY2016, the total cost of services provided to charity care was $9,788,000. The cost figure on the audited financial statement is different because it is calculated utilizing a cost accounting methodology which allocates full cost and is not derived from the cost to charge ratio from the Medicare Cost Report which includes only “allowable costs” as defined by the Medicare program",,Karishma Parekh,"Director, Business Planning and Decision Support",3/17/17,
